# Not all numbers contain the same amount of information

All natural numbers are products of prime numbers. Thus, prime numbers form the basis set responsible for all Natural numbers and hence can be thought of as the unit of all information. In this analysis, I have counted the prime factors of each natural number, i.e. the information that each number contains. This program finds all the prime factors of each number from 1 to 1 Million and plots the information contained in each number. The following plots shows such information across different scales which is surprisely a fractal. This is an ongoing invesitgation.

## Usage
```bash
python3 primes.py
```
